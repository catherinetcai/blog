Another year around the sun. Another year of this blog being sorely neglected. Whoops.

I liked the approach that I took [last year]({{< ref "New Year, Old Me.md" >}}), where I listed some of my accomplishments for the year and some low expectations for what I want to do for the next year.

I'm going to see if I actually checked off any of the boxes I set out for myself from 2017.

### Things I Had Hoped to Achieve in 2018
#### Ship a MVP of my side project
Em nope. Didn't happen. I did make a huge dent in it in 2018 and I actually roped in a lot of friends to help me out. I'm actually more proud of the growth that we all saw together as a team. The experience we got just growing and learning together was way more valuable than actually shipping this project.

#### Crush more lifting PRs (Bench: 150lb, Deadlift: 250lb, Squat: 230lb)
I **absolutely** crushed this one. I discovered [nSuns](https://www.reddit.com/r/nsuns), a Reddit user's variation on a well-known lifting routine called 5/3/1 at the end of 2017. nSuns, the creator of the program, ran it while he was a on a huge cut.

I wasn't crazy enough to do that. I decided to bulk while running the program and it absolutely gave me bonkers results.

I'd like to thank both nSuns and eating carbs again for this wonderful accomplishment.

**Final tally - Bench: 170lb, Deadlift: 300lb, Squat: 265lb**

#### Learn another language
I certainly did learn another langague, though it wasn't Clojure, Rust, or Elixir. It was actually C. I had to learn it within a couple of weeks for the OS class I took as a part of OMSCS.

#### Continue to not go instane though Trump is our president
No comment.

#### Visit Thailand for the first time
This one didn't end up happening. However, I did end up taking trips to Iceland, Australia, and New Zealand this year. I think the sentiment behind this one was at least fulfilled (though I am a little salty that Australia and New Zealand don't stamp your passport so my passport doesn't reflect that I've been).

#### Visit NYC for the first time
I did go to NYC and I loved it! Well, I loved Brooklyn. Manhattan... not so much. Still a bit of a toss up on this one.

#### Dress more like an adult (specifically, get my first wedding-appropriate set of clothes)
I don't know about dressing more like an adult on the whole, but I did get wedding attire. I ended up getting a [Wildfang](https://www.wildfang.com/) suit and having it tailored. [Here](https://www.instagram.com/p/BjAQIt2jU7-/) is the Instagram of the end result.

#### Write more WTF Algorithms
Nope. Didn't really happen. And that's ok. Just in between writing code for work, writing code for my side projects, and writing code for class, I didn't honestly feel like sitting down and drilling algorithms.

### Conclusion
**Not bad**. I'm actually pretty pleased with myself for the lifting one, specifically. I thought my goals were already pretty lofty and I ended up smashing through the ceiling. But, I think it does leave out other things I did in 2018.

### Things I've Done in 2018
- Stayed at my job (which is a good sign, it means I didn't rage quit immediately)
- Started feeling like a "competent" engineer (I have much more confidence now that when given a hard problem and enough time, I can resolve them)
- Visited Iceland for the first time (and I plan on going back because Iceland is amazing)
- Visited Australia and New Zealand for the first time
- Started living alone
- Continued working on my side project (so yay, it's actually a project I can stick to)

I think the difference between this year and last year is that I'm not sure if I feel proud of where I am in 2018. I definitely feel like I've grown as an engineer. But I think my fixation on working so much via side projects, starting a master's program, and stepping up at work has taken a huge human cost. Even though I've moved out and started living alone, my apartment's been relatively untouched and undecorated (and I started living alone in late July) since I haven't been home. I've also realized that my only hobby as of late is powerlifting. With that in mind...

### Things I Hope to Achieve in 2019
- Ship a MVP of my (really, I should say **our** since this project is not just mine) side project
- Crush more lifting PRs (Bench: 185lb, Deadlift: 350lb, Squat: 300lb)
- Learn Rust
- Decorate my apartment
- Go on a solo trip to another country
- Finish watching Westworld
- Play more videogames
- Start cooking again (like baking bread or something)

I think last year I set a lot of goals that were very focused on work (with the caveat of some travel). However, I think the amount of work I threw myself into has really taken a mental toll. I've rarely had weekends where I can just sit and watch TV (since I have to be working on homework, or my side project, or day job work).

This year, I'm hoping to be a little more human. I know people would say **balanced**, but I think **balance** is a loaded term. People have different tolerations of what balance is supposed to be, and I would say for the first half of the year, the amount of work I was cracking out **was** balanced and what I needed at the time. But, now that 2018 is coming to a close... I'm tired. And my situation has changed so that that isn't what works for me anymore.

I guess I'm hoping to go into 2019 with just lowered expectations about achievements... and just being more okay with functioning like a regular human who watches TV, plays videogames, and bakes bread or something.
