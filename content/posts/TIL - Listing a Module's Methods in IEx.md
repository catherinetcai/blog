In Ruby, you can query any object for a list of its public methods just by calling 'methods' on it.
There's a similar function in Elixir (sort of.) You can grab any module's methods just by typing it's name, followed by a '.' in IEx and then hitting tab. It'll bring out a list of that module's functions.
