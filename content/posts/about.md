## About Me
Hi! My name is Cat Cai. I'm a software engineer who currently bumbles around a lot in Kubernetes and Go. I've also been known to sometimes do Ruby, Python (poorly), and JavaScript (mostly for React Native). 

In the not-so-distant past I was a tech and games freelance journalist for the likes of [VG247](https://www.vg247.com/) and [Tom's Hardware](https://www.tomshardware.com/). I used to also work as a lighting director and technician around Los Angeles.

## About this blog
This blog is just an odd assortments of engineering things that I've found interesting/complexing/just overall strange as I wade through the tech world. 

I'm hoping that some of the things I write about end up helping others. (They've certainly helped me sometimes. I'll be a year past a problem and end up digging through my old notes and blog posts and end up finding the solution.)

## Getting in Touch
While I'm not the best about keeping my social media (or this blog, let's be real) up to date, I love getting feedback about what I'm writing about. I've had the privilege of working with many smart people who've always given me good pointers/constructive notes on how to improve my process and code thinking.

I'm reachable at my [Twitter](https://twitter.com/catherinetcai). If for some reason you don't want to reach out via Twitter, you can always hit me up via LinkedIn(https://www.linkedin.com/in/catherine-ting-cai/).
