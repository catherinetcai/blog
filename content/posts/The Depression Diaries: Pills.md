"You're depressed."

I shrugged and gave a half-assed response that was something along the lines of *it's not that bad*. It wasn't. At least I didn't think it was.

That was over six months ago.

It wasn't that bad.

Until it was. Welp.

I'm the moron who waits until things get **really** fucked before I go to the doctor. So I waited through two years of having interrupted sleep, constant self-flagellation for not meeting unrealistic expectations, and feeling numb. I waited until I started having irrational bouts of anxiety over my schedule. Scheduling time with friends became emotionally exhausting because *I could be spending that time getting more work done* or *I could be at the gym instead*. If I wasn't killing it, I was failing.

The worst part was that I thought this was normal. So of course I sat and lied to my therapist's face and said that "things weren't that bad".

This week marks two full weeks of being on Lexapro. I started on a 5mg dose. This past Thursday, I moved up to 10mg.
