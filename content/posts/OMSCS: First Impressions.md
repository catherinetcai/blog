Ah the beginning of a new year. A time for sitting down and realizing that everything you intended on doing with the "new year" a year ago didn't really happen.

I ended 2017 with the intent of contributing to my blog more. That (clearly) didn't happen. Most of that was due to an ever-growing list of responsibilities that inevitably comes with working at a [growing and successful ~~unicorn~~ startup](https://techcrunch.com/2018/12/20/fair-com-gets-385m-led-by-softbank-to-grow-its-flexible-car-ownership-model-globally/). The other half of my time disappeared to various side projects and Georgia Tech's [OMSCS](http://www.omscs.gatech.edu/explore-oms-cs) program, which I started in the fall of this year.

## So... Why a Master's?
Well... I didn't actually become interested in this program for the degree. I know. It's a trite thing to say. But it's true! I actually wouldn't be upset if I paid and took these courses and didn't have a nice shiny piece of paper at the end of it.

One of the things I realized I'd been missing in my day-to-day work life was a deeper understanding of operating systems and networking concepts. As an infrastructure engineer, I touch a lot of the concepts related to computing systems, but I don't actually end up getting to deep dive into any of those concepts since any research or learning I do is driven by need to deliver business value. For example, one of my favorite moments at work were spent digging into IP table rules and understanding how NAT worked in order to debug some Kubernetes networking issues, but once I learned how to fix the issue, I did so and moved on.
