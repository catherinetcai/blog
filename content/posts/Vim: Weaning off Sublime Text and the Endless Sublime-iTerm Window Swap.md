When I started in development, Sublime was my text editor of choice. It was pretty minimal and had a ton of useful plugins that were easy to configure and set up.&nbsp;
However, when I started tackling on bigger projects at work, Sublime's ctrl+p slowed to a crawl and I found myself constantly swapping back and forth between iTerm and Sublime to write and run tests. There had to be a better way.
One of my coworkers led me down the Vim rabbit hole. I would never have to leave iTerm for any of my work. It took a little time (and a little back and forth between using Sublime and Vim) and a couple of plugins to get used to operating full time with Vim.
&nbsp;-&nbsp;
Vim plugins are a lifesaver. If you're using Vim without them, mad props. I don't think I would have ever been able to make the swap without them. Here's a couple that I have for parity between my Vim setup and my old Sublime setup:
* Package manager - There are a couple of Vim package managers out there. I personally use [Vundle](https://github.com/VundleVim/Vundle.vim), because you can list out all your Vim packages in your vimrc. It's very quick and easy to set up. Alternatives: [Neobundle](https://github.com/Shougo/neobundle.vim), [Pathogen](https://github.com/tpope/vim-pathogen), [vim-plug](https://github.com/junegunn/vim-plug).* ctrl + p - Using ctrl + p (or cmd + p if you're a Mac user) to fuzzy search through files was huge for me. Thankfully, the [CtrlP](https://github.com/kien/ctrlp.vim) plugin for Vim does essentially the same thing.&nbsp;* Directories - I think my biggest annoyance with Vim when I first moved over was the lack of a directory at startup. You can type in :Explore or :E in Vim to enter Explore mode, which will show you the directories. However, having to toggle between that and Normal mode is pretty inefficient. There are a couple of solutions out there. The most popular I've seen is [Nerdtree](https://github.com/scrooloose/nerdtree), which I used in my Vim setup until very recently. (See this [post](https://medium.com/@mozhuuuuu/vimmers-you-dont-need-nerdtree-18f627b561c3)&nbsp;on my reason for attempting to move away from Nerdtree.) I've also seen [VimFiler](https://github.com/Shougo/vimfiler.vim)&nbsp;as an alternative.* Fuzzy find/search - One of my gripes with Sublime is how slow its Find All function is once you're working in a bigger project. Still, I used and abused that feature. Vim's solution is a [plugin](https://github.com/rking/ag.vim) for [The Silver Searcher](https://github.com/ggreer/the_silver_searcher), which is a blazing-fast alternative to grepping for code. Typing in :Ag 'your search term here' and getting results in milliseconds is crazy satisfying.&nbsp;* Git Integration - Sublime has great plugins for Git, and so does Vim. [vim-fugitive](https://github.com/tpope/vim-fugitive) is available for all your Git blame needs.
* [vim-endwise](https://github.com/tpope/vim-endwise) - Autocomplete those ends for method definitions and blocks* [vim-rails](https://github.com/tpope/vim-rails)&nbsp;- Run Rails commands right from your Vim setup.* [vim-ruby](https://github.com/vim-ruby/vim-ruby)&nbsp;- Syntax highlighting for Ruby* [vim-eunuch](https://github.com/tpope/vim-eunuch)&nbsp;- Have an easier time making directories, renaming files, deleting files, etc. in Vim* [vim-dispatch](https://github.com/tpope/vim-dispatch)&nbsp;- My true answer to window swapping. You don't need to create split windows or new tabs in iTerm, vim-dispatch will run commands asynchronously in a window below your Vim setup without disrupting it. Yes, you can run your RSpecs directly beneath your tests as you write them.
