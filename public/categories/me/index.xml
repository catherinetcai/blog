      <description>Another year around the sun. Another year of this blog being sorely neglected. Whoops.
I liked the approach that I took last year, where I listed some of my accomplishments for the year and some low expectations for what I want to do for the next year.
I&amp;rsquo;m going to see if I actually checked off any of the boxes I set out for myself from 2017.
Things I Had Hoped to Achieve in 2018 Ship a MVP of my side project Em nope.</description>

      <description>I&amp;rsquo;m not a New Year&amp;rsquo;s Resolution person, mostly because I don&amp;rsquo;t think they work. I&amp;rsquo;m not opposed to the idea, I just think that they take a wrongheaded approach (for me). Picking up a new habit is a lot of hard work, and I think trying to kick off a new year with the idea that it&amp;rsquo;s going to be a complete &amp;ldquo;fresh start&amp;rdquo; I think puts people in the wrong mindset for setting a habit.</description>
