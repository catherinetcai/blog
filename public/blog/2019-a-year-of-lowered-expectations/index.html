  <p>Another year around the sun. Another year of this blog being sorely neglected. Whoops.</p>
<p>I liked the approach that I took <a href="https://www.catherinetcai.com/blog/new-year-old-me/">last year</a>, where I listed some of my accomplishments for the year and some low expectations for what I want to do for the next year.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m going to see if I actually checked off any of the boxes I set out for myself from 2017.</p>
<h3 id="things-i-had-hoped-to-achieve-in-2018">Things I Had Hoped to Achieve in 2018</h3>
<h4 id="ship-a-mvp-of-my-side-project">Ship a MVP of my side project</h4>
<p>Em nope. Didn&rsquo;t happen. I did make a huge dent in it in 2018 and I actually roped in a lot of friends to help me out. I&rsquo;m actually more proud of the growth that we all saw together as a team. The experience we got just growing and learning together was way more valuable than actually shipping this project.</p>
<h4 id="crush-more-lifting-prs-bench-150lb-deadlift-250lb-squat-230lb">Crush more lifting PRs (Bench: 150lb, Deadlift: 250lb, Squat: 230lb)</h4>
<p>I <strong>absolutely</strong> crushed this one. I discovered <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/nsuns">nSuns</a>, a Reddit user&rsquo;s variation on a well-known lifting routine called 5/3/1 at the end of 2017. nSuns, the creator of the program, ran it while he was a on a huge cut.</p>
<p>I wasn&rsquo;t crazy enough to do that. I decided to bulk while running the program and it absolutely gave me bonkers results.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;d like to thank both nSuns and eating carbs again for this wonderful accomplishment.</p>
<p><strong>Final tally - Bench: 170lb, Deadlift: 300lb, Squat: 265lb</strong></p>
<h4 id="learn-another-language">Learn another language</h4>
<p>I certainly did learn another langague, though it wasn&rsquo;t Clojure, Rust, or Elixir. It was actually C. I had to learn it within a couple of weeks for the OS class I took as a part of OMSCS.</p>
<h4 id="continue-to-not-go-instane-though-trump-is-our-president">Continue to not go instane though Trump is our president</h4>
<p>No comment.</p>
<h4 id="visit-thailand-for-the-first-time">Visit Thailand for the first time</h4>
<p>This one didn&rsquo;t end up happening. However, I did end up taking trips to Iceland, Australia, and New Zealand this year. I think the sentiment behind this one was at least fulfilled (though I am a little salty that Australia and New Zealand don&rsquo;t stamp your passport so my passport doesn&rsquo;t reflect that I&rsquo;ve been).</p>
<h4 id="visit-nyc-for-the-first-time">Visit NYC for the first time</h4>
<p>I did go to NYC and I loved it! Well, I loved Brooklyn. Manhattan&hellip; not so much. Still a bit of a toss up on this one.</p>
<h4 id="dress-more-like-an-adult-specifically-get-my-first-wedding-appropriate-set-of-clothes">Dress more like an adult (specifically, get my first wedding-appropriate set of clothes)</h4>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know about dressing more like an adult on the whole, but I did get wedding attire. I ended up getting a <a href="https://www.wildfang.com/">Wildfang</a> suit and having it tailored. <a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/BjAQIt2jU7-/">Here</a> is the Instagram of the end result.</p>
<h4 id="write-more-wtf-algorithms">Write more WTF Algorithms</h4>
<p>Nope. Didn&rsquo;t really happen. And that&rsquo;s ok. Just in between writing code for work, writing code for my side projects, and writing code for class, I didn&rsquo;t honestly feel like sitting down and drilling algorithms.</p>
<h3 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h3>
<p><strong>Not bad</strong>. I&rsquo;m actually pretty pleased with myself for the lifting one, specifically. I thought my goals were already pretty lofty and I ended up smashing through the ceiling. But, I think it does leave out other things I did in 2018.</p>
<h3 id="things-ive-done-in-2018">Things I&rsquo;ve Done in 2018</h3>
<ul>
<li>Stayed at my job (which is a good sign, it means I didn&rsquo;t rage quit immediately)</li>
<li>Started feeling like a &ldquo;competent&rdquo; engineer (I have much more confidence now that when given a hard problem and enough time, I can resolve them)</li>
<li>Visited Iceland for the first time (and I plan on going back because Iceland is amazing)</li>
<li>Visited Australia and New Zealand for the first time</li>
<li>Started living alone</li>
<li>Continued working on my side project (so yay, it&rsquo;s actually a project I can stick to)</li>
</ul>
<p>I think the difference between this year and last year is that I&rsquo;m not sure if I feel proud of where I am in 2018. I definitely feel like I&rsquo;ve grown as an engineer. But I think my fixation on working so much via side projects, starting a master&rsquo;s program, and stepping up at work has taken a huge human cost. Even though I&rsquo;ve moved out and started living alone, my apartment&rsquo;s been relatively untouched and undecorated (and I started living alone in late July) since I haven&rsquo;t been home. I&rsquo;ve also realized that my only hobby as of late is powerlifting. With that in mind&hellip;</p>
<h3 id="things-i-hope-to-achieve-in-2019">Things I Hope to Achieve in 2019</h3>
<ul>
<li>Ship a MVP of my (really, I should say <strong>our</strong> since this project is not just mine) side project</li>
<li>Crush more lifting PRs (Bench: 185lb, Deadlift: 350lb, Squat: 300lb)</li>
<li>Learn Rust</li>
<li>Decorate my apartment</li>
<li>Go on a solo trip to another country</li>
<li>Finish watching Westworld</li>
<li>Play more videogames</li>
<li>Start cooking again (like baking bread or something)</li>
</ul>
<p>I think last year I set a lot of goals that were very focused on work (with the caveat of some travel). However, I think the amount of work I threw myself into has really taken a mental toll. I&rsquo;ve rarely had weekends where I can just sit and watch TV (since I have to be working on homework, or my side project, or day job work).</p>
<p>This year, I&rsquo;m hoping to be a little more human. I know people would say <strong>balanced</strong>, but I think <strong>balance</strong> is a loaded term. People have different tolerations of what balance is supposed to be, and I would say for the first half of the year, the amount of work I was cracking out <strong>was</strong> balanced and what I needed at the time. But, now that 2018 is coming to a close&hellip; I&rsquo;m tired. And my situation has changed so that that isn&rsquo;t what works for me anymore.</p>
<p>I guess I&rsquo;m hoping to go into 2019 with just lowered expectations about achievements&hellip; and just being more okay with functioning like a regular human who watches TV, plays videogames, and bakes bread or something.</p>
