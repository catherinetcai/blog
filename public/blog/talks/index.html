<p>My coworker Marshall Brekka and I talked about the cross-cluster controller we wrote to handle routing between our two Kubernetes cluster. It leverages/abuses the AWS VPC CNI, K8 services, and K8 endpoints so that the application layer can call to applications in another cluster as if it were in its own cluster. <a href="https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/10XcKahvyRkGChDhB0DNTrbZwcdt2RHnkY_wg7McrGSI/edit#slide=id.g4249b9029b_0_43">slides here</a></p>
