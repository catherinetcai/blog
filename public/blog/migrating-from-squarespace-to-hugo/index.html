  <p>The migration is complete&hellip; almost. Some of my previous blog posts are probably still improperly formatted and some of my lighting portfolio didn&rsquo;t seem to make the cut at all.</p>
<p>SquareSpace&rsquo;s formatting doesn&rsquo;t make it conducive to migrating your blog to anything other than Wordpress, to put it lightly. You can export your entire site into XML, which is&hellip; <em>ugh</em>. I decided to decide the mild headache it was to migrate from SquareSpace to Hugo hosted on GitHub Pages just in case I decided I wanted to retrace my steps in doing this again. Not that I think I am. I really like SquareSpace, but it&rsquo;s primary purpose isn&rsquo;t as a blogging engine.</p>
<p><strong>Challenge 1: XML to Markdown</strong>
Thankfully, the Internet always has solutions if you Google Fu hard enough. I used a lightly modified version of <a href="https://github.com/kodsnack/sqs-to-hugo">this</a> to convert everything into Markdown for Hugo (most of it was going through and try/catching a couple things that would blow up due to weird formatting).</p>
<p><strong>Challenge 2: Hugo Themes</strong>
GitHub Pages supports Jekyll right out of the box, but I wanted to give <a href="https://github.com/gohugoio/hugo">Hugo</a> a spin, since I&rsquo;ve been a worshipper at the cult of Golang as of late. (Not really, but I&rsquo;ve been coding Go about 90% of the time for over a year now.) Hugo takes a little bit more setup than Jekyll does, but it&rsquo;s mostly due to a couple of weird quirks around theming.</p>
<p>Hugo&rsquo;s <a href="https://gohugo.io/getting-started/quick-start/">quickstart</a> guide is amazing for getting going. I was dumb and tried to set up this blog via a combination of my work (Macbook Pro) and home (Dell XPS 15 running Elementary Freya) laptops. I made the dumb mistake of initially installing Hugo via <code>apt-get</code>, which gets you a pretty outdated version of Hugo. Follow Hugo&rsquo;s docs to <a href="https://gohugo.io/getting-started/installing/">install it via Snap</a> or just compile the binary on your own. Seriously, just do it. I ended up having a mild WTF moment when Hugo would work fine on my work laptop, but not my home laptop.</p>
<p>Anyway, Hugo oddly doesn&rsquo;t ship with any sort of default theme. That means once you&rsquo;ve migrated and added all your content and run Hugo, you&rsquo;ll see&hellip; nothing. Yup. Just a big fat white blank page. No errors. Cool cool cool. You <em>must</em> have a theme installed, so just find one and download it or <code>git clone</code> it into the &ldquo;themes&rdquo; directory of your project and add the name in your config.toml file. I ended up installing <a href="https://themes.gohugo.io/beautifulhugo/">beautifulhugo</a> by making a git submodule.</p>
<p>Once that&rsquo;s done, when you run Hugo, you should actually see your content. Huzzah!</p>
<p><strong>Challenge 3: Hugo to GitHub Pages</strong>
You can deploy Hugo to display on GitHub Pages a <a href="https://gohugo.io/hosting-and-deployment/hosting-on-github/">couple of ways</a>. Since I wanted my blog to run at catherinetcai.github.io, I ended up opting to go with a setup where all of my post content is in a separate <a href="https://github.com/catherinetcai/blog">blog</a> repo and I set up my catherinetcai.github.io repo in the public/ folder and set up the public/ folder as a submodule. The guide also provides a helpful deploy script so that every time you have new content, it&rsquo;ll commit and push to the public folder for you.</p>
<p>And there it is! Blog migrated. Sort of. I&rsquo;ve set up the domain to point to the right place, but now I&rsquo;ll have to set up CloudFlare or something else for SSL. Huzzah.</p>
