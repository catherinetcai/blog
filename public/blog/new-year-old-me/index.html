  <p>I&rsquo;m not a New Year&rsquo;s Resolution person, mostly because I don&rsquo;t think they work. I&rsquo;m not opposed to the idea, I just think that they take a wrongheaded approach (for me). Picking up a new habit is a lot of hard work, and I think trying to kick off a new year with the idea that it&rsquo;s going to be a complete &ldquo;fresh start&rdquo; I think puts people in the wrong mindset for setting a habit.</p>
<p>2018 is going to be just that. Nothing really changes, except that you&rsquo;re just now forced to write 2018 down on everything (and inevitably get it wrong for most of January/February if you&rsquo;re me). A lot of <del>2017</del>2018s aside, there&rsquo;s not really much of a mental shift. I really think that if you&rsquo;re going into the new year with the mindset that the moment the ball drops in Time Square that everything&rsquo;s going to change, you&rsquo;re destined to fail.</p>
<p>With that&hellip; new year, same me - except I hope that I make some improvements in 2018 and I don&rsquo;t pick up too many more bad habits. I do think it&rsquo;s healthy to reflect on the things you&rsquo;ve achieved in the past year or so, so you can have a realistic expectation of what can be achieved for the next year.</p>
<h3 id="things-ive-done-in-2017">Things I&rsquo;ve Done in 2017</h3>
<ul>
<li>Quit a job I liked</li>
<li>Started a new job</li>
<li>Started my first job as a &ldquo;senior&rdquo; engineering person (whatever that&rsquo;s supposed to mean, but I guess the title bump is cool!)</li>
<li>Actually felt like I was a &ldquo;real&rdquo; engineer (thanks imposter&rsquo;s syndrome)</li>
<li>Visited Tokyo for the first time</li>
<li>Visited Kauai for the first time</li>
<li>Went through my worst breakup yet</li>
<li>Moved in with my business partner and his wife</li>
<li>Started a side project that I&rsquo;ve actually stuck to</li>
<li>Crushed my lifting PRs (Bench: 135lb, Deadlift: 220lb, Squat: 205lb)</li>
<li>Didn&rsquo;t go insane even though Trump is our president</li>
</ul>
<p>That&rsquo;s actually a fairly sizeable breakdown for 2017. I&rsquo;m actually pretty proud, all things considered (especially with that last one).</p>
<p>With that said, I think there are a couple things I hope to accomplish in 2018.</p>
<h3 id="things-i-hope-to-achieve-in-2018-but-i-wont-be-horribly-mad-about-if-i-dont-achieve">Things I Hope to Achieve in 2018 (but I won&rsquo;t be horribly mad about if I don&rsquo;t achieve)</h3>
<ul>
<li>Ship a MVP of my side project</li>
<li>Crush more lifting PRs (Bench: 150lb, Deadlift: 250lb, Squat: 230lb)</li>
<li>Learn another language (Clojure/Rust/Elixir)</li>
<li>Continue to not go insane even though Trump is our president</li>
<li>Visit Thailand for the first time</li>
<li>Visit NYC for the first time</li>
<li>Dress more like an adult (specifically, get my first wedding-appropriate set of clothes)</li>
<li>Write more WTF Algorithms (I got lax on this one)</li>
</ul>
<p>I think these are all fairly realistic, and solid goals to have for 2018. I think having honed/drilled down goals (while sometimes demotivating when you can&rsquo;t hit them) makes it so that mentally you actually have numbers to hit. And, there&rsquo;s nothing sweeping there that makes it seem like I&rsquo;m going the route of completely changing myself.</p>
