  <p>I&rsquo;m excited to announce that I&rsquo;m now the proud (and broke) owner of a brand new 15&rdquo; Macbook Pro (2017).</p>
<p>I know, I know. I should have waited until Fall 2018 for Apple to announce a refresh. My rationale for getting the new laptop is mostly that I had been waiting for a refresh at WWDC. If none came, I was going to get one anyway since I&rsquo;ve been holding off for a long time. Say what you will about Apple and their current state of hardware, I&rsquo;ll take a touchbar and a garbage keyboard any day over any of the other hardware offerings out there right now. (I got myself a XPS 15 about a year and a half ago and booting Elementary OS and having to hack around with the graphics driver and the 4K display was a terrible experience.)</p>
<p>Anyway, that&rsquo;s neither here nor there. I&rsquo;m here to discuss dotfiles and bootstrapping a new laptop.</p>
<p>A lot of my friends have their development environment bootstrapping down to an art form. Some of them have public repos of well-organized dotfiles. My friend and former colleague <a href="https://naftuli.wtf/">Naftuli</a> has an Ansible role set up for his Vim setup and for every single language he develops in (hell, for every language he MIGHT develop in). I&rsquo;ve never been quite as&hellip; diligent about maintaining my setup for bootstrapping my laptop. I forked <a href="https://github.com/catherinetcai/grindr-laptop">thoughtbot&rsquo;s laptop</a> script a while ago to help quickly bootstrap Grindr development environments a couple of years ago, but that&rsquo;s about the extent of my upkeep for starting a development environment. I just keep my init.vim for Neovim and .zshrc in a secret gist on GitHub and copy paste it whenever I start a new job or get a new laptop. Then I just apt-get or brew whatever it is that I need whenever I&rsquo;m doing something and run into realizing I don&rsquo;t have a specific tool/package. It&rsquo;s a pretty cringe and inefficient setup considering 90% of my job is identifying inefficiencies and writing tooling to automate those processes. (I promise I&rsquo;m pretty decent at what I do. It&rsquo;s just like how professional chefs probably don&rsquo;t want to cook at home, right?)</p>
<p>I decided that since I was willing to invest a ton of money into a laptop for my work, I should also spend some time making it much cleaning up my development setup too. This meant modularizing my .zshrc and my Vim set up, which I hadn&rsquo;t done before because I thought it was too much of a pain.</p>
<p>To give you a little idea of just how dilipidated/messy my setup was prior to this cleanup&hellip; well, my zsh and Vim setup are things I threw together when I was but a wee half-time software engineering intern baby child trying to figure out what Vim even was back in November of 2014. I just grabbed a ton of plugins on the recommendation of my coworkers at the time and got going. Over the years, I just kept tacking on stuff (with some minor cleanups here and there, I&rsquo;m not a complete trash person) as I learned more languages and needed to expand my toolset. But tl;dr - yes, both my zshrc and init.vim needed a lot of love.</p>
<p>I first looked into something that I could manage and upload my dotfile managers with. I came across <a href="https://github.com/TheLocehiliosan/yadm">yadm</a>, which really is just a nice wrapper around git and uploading dotfiles. There&rsquo;s a couple other nice things that come with it like encryption, etc. I explored it for a bit, but honestly I didn&rsquo;t get the sense that there wasn&rsquo;t anything there that I couldn&rsquo;t handle on my own with some Bash and git. However, I did come away from yadm discovering <a href="https://github.com/Homebrew/homebrew-bundle">Brewfiles</a>.</p>
<p>Having used Homebrew for years, I&rsquo;m actually a little embarrassed that I&rsquo;d never heard of Brewfiles or Homebrew-Bundle. Essentially, Brewfiles work like Ruby Bundler&rsquo;s <a href="https://bundler.io/gemfile.html">Gemfile</a>. You dictate a recipe that outlines the brew dependencies that you want to download, run <code>brew bundle</code> and Homebrew will pull all the dependencies for you. Homebrew-Bundle also supports brew cask dependencies, along with Mac App Store downloads. This meant I could literally just install Homebrew and be able to pull everything I&rsquo;ve ever wanted to use immediately. You can see my current Brewfile that I&rsquo;m running <a href="https://github.com/catherinetcai/dotfiles/blob/master/brew/Brewfile">here</a>, though I&rsquo;ve slowly been adding to it as I discover more and more desktop apps that I run into. Brewfiles essentially saved me from having to kludge together some sort of horrifying Bash script to curl/wget all of my base software dependencies.</p>
<p>I then just needed to modularize and split up my .zshrc and Neovim configurations.</p>
<p>For my zshrc, I really just needed to split up everything that I had in there. It was something like a 240-lined monster that was impossible to parse (to be fair, most of it was commented out settings from oh-my-zsh). After reading through a couple other people&rsquo;s setups, I found most people split up their .bashrc or .zshrc by specific functions. For me, I ended up deciding to just split off environment variable exports, aliases, and functions, and then sourcing them into my main .zshrc file. My split up zsh files are <a href="https://github.com/catherinetcai/dotfiles/tree/master/system/zsh">here</a>, though I just want to specifically call out these <a href="https://github.com/catherinetcai/dotfiles/blob/master/system/zsh/.zshrc#L1-L15">lines of bash</a> (also apologies ahead of time for my not-so-great bash). I essentially declared an array of where each dotfile was, wrote a quick helper function to source the file (or echo an error if the file isn&rsquo;t found) and looped through the array to source them.</p>
<p>Neovim was actually a little bit more tricky. I wasn&rsquo;t really sure how to split it up other than knowing that my plugin installation declarations were really long, so that could be something I could pull out. Through a lot of Googling, I came across <a href="https://github.com/greg-js/dotfiles/tree/master/.config/nvim/config">greg-js&rsquo;s setup</a>. (greg-js, whoever you are, you&rsquo;re a G. Thanks for your help.) They ended up having their init.vim be just a file that sources other configs, and then splitting out their configurations into plugin installation, plugin configuration, setting sane Vim defaults, and key remappings. I ended up going with the exact <a href="https://github.com/catherinetcai/dotfiles/tree/master/nvim/config">same approach</a>.</p>
<p>The last problem I had to solve was just having it be an automated process. I decided to throw together two quick bash scripts to handle bootstrapping a laptop running MacOS (I&rsquo;ll write something for automating Linux one day when I get back to using my XPS&hellip; maybe&hellip;). The first is a <a href="https://github.com/catherinetcai/dotfiles/blob/master/bootstrap.sh">bootstrap script</a> that installs Homebrew, Homebrew-Bundle, rbenv and pyenv. It wraps up my copy pasting my .gitconfig and my .zsh over into the $HOME directory. The script isn&rsquo;t the most elegant solution, but at the very least I can run it as many times as I want to. For now, the script will overwrite whatever&rsquo;s in the $HOME directory if zsh or gitconfigs are present, though I think over time I&rsquo;ll adapt it to ask for user input about overwriting certain files (if I ever get the patience to write that in Bash). The other <a href="https://github.com/catherinetcai/dotfiles/blob/master/nvim.sh">bash script</a> just installs Ruby, Python 2/3, and Node for Neovim. I wish I could have all of this in the same automation script, but I wasn&rsquo;t sure how to source a new zshrc file to pick up all the changes necessary for pyenv, rbenv, and virtualenv to work right.</p>
<p>In any case, the solution&rsquo;s a little clumsy, at least in terms of the bootstrapping portion, but I&rsquo;m going to call the fact that I&rsquo;ve cleaned up my dotfiles a win.</p>
