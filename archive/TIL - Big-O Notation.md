This is continuing with my adventures in attempting to learn and understand algorithms.
Yesterday, I learned about Big-Theta notation, which describes the asymptotic bounds of the running time of an algorithm.
Big-O notation is very similar to Big-Theta notation, except Big-Theta notation describes both the upper and lower bounds of the running time of an algorithm, whereas Big-O notation only describes the upper asymptotic bound of the running time of an algorithm.&nbsp;
Apparently if you say that the running time of something is
